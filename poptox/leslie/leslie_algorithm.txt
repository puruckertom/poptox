<p>To build a Leslie model, one need to know the following inputs:</p>

<p>The fecundiy can be viewed as the number of offspring produced at the next age class</p>
<p><i>B<sub>k+1</sub></i>weighted by the probability of reaching the next age class.</p>

<p>The Leslie model is described by the following two equations:</p>

<p>where the first equation estimates the number of offspring produced by each age class,</p>
<p>and the second equation estimates the number of individuals survived from age class k-1</p>
<p>to k. Thus we can present Leslie model in terms of system of equations as:</p>

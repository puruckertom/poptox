<p>The model developed by Khoury et al. (2011) was developed to aid in testing hypothesis relating to honey bee colony failure. The model uses compartments to simulate different parts of a honey bee colony, which allow you to assess the impact of forager deaths on overall honey bee colony numbers.</p>
<p>The equation for the ecclosion rate or the number of eggs hatched in a colony:</p>

<p>The rate at which have bees become foragers. The right sight represents the social inhibition and how the number of foragers decreases the rate at which hive bees turn into foragers.:</p>

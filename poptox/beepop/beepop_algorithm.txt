<p>In the beepop model the bees in each class are tracked on a daily basis. Rate of movement through the classes (larvae, worker bee, forager) is determined by user inputs. Disturbances to the hive can also be simulated by the modeler. For example, when a swarm is simulated the user can specify a percentage of bees that leaves and that percentage is taken evenly from all classes.</p>

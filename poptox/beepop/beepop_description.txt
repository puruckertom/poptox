<p>BEEPOP simulates honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera L.</i>) colony population dynamics. The model is comprised of a number of different elements which interact to determine bee hive dynamics, including colony condition (e.g. initial size, reproductive potential of the queen, and forager longevity), environmental variability (weather), colony energetics (intake and consumption of food), and contaminant exposure.</p>
<p>A number of demographic parameters are adjustable by the user (e.g. how many bees the colony starts out with, queen egg laying rate, division of labor parameters). Additionally, the user can simulate how various disturbances affect final bee population sizes. Disturbances include swarming, extreme weather events, application of a pesticides, brood disease (e.g. Chalkbrood disease), Queen supercedure, resource depletion).</p>

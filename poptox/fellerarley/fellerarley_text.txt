<p>
Feller-Arley Markov process is also known as the birth-death process, which assumes:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>no internal population structure, each individual can give birth and death</li>
  <li>the birth rate and death rate are constant</li>
</ul>
<p>As a Markov procees, the future population size is only related to its neighbor state. 
In the below figure, when a birth occurs, the process goes from state n to n + 1. 
When a death occurs, the process goes from state n to state n-1. The possibility of "moving"
to another state is governed by the birth and death rates.</p>

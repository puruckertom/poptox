<p>
Yule-Furry Markov process is also known as the pure birth process, which models the growth of population under 
ideal conditions: </p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>the population size will not decrease (no mortality)</li>
  <li>no interspecies competition</li>
  <li>no internal population structure, the birth rate is the same for each individual</li>
</ul>
<p>Yule-Furry process was originally introduced by Yule (1924) to model 
new species evolution and by Furry (1937) to model particle creation. 
As a Markov procees, the future population size is only related to its previous state: </p>
